## Gamble Dao - Combining Blast Yield with Composability

GambleDAO is a GambleFi project that leverages on Blast native yield features to allow users to bet on their ETH's future yield. [Try it out now!](https://gamble-dao.vercel.app/).

The project is designed in a way to be plug-and-play. Though we will initially develop simple games for users to play like WeatherQuest (check it out [here](https://weatherdao.vercel.app/)), anyone can potentially use our tokenised yield token to develop games on top off. This gives us the potential to partner with many communities and provide a fun, lossless experience
